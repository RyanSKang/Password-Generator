# <Module-Challenge-3>

## Description
The Password Generator challenge helped me utilize the concepts of manipulating DOM (Document Object Model), defining variables, creating functions, conditional statements, creating prompts/confirm statements, logging consoles, and implementing array/string methods in order to achieve a functional web-application. It forced me to understand why I am defining a variable and calling the variable in order to return a response from JavaScript through user-interaction. I did have some trouble when creating functions and knowing when to execute them, but during the process, I was able to read JavaScript line by line and understand when the function is applicable locally or globally in order to deploy a sucessful application. In the beginning it was very overwhelming, but I commented down the necessary steps and goals within this project and coded in parts depending on what I needed under my comments. This project was particularly challenging due to having our main instructor absent and using multiple substitute teachers; therefore, I was not accustomed to the various teaching methods or explanations given to me. I had to outsource to youtube, google, and rewatch the lectures of this topic to get a grasp understanding of JavaScript and my objectives within this project. I am grateful for understanding how to read the console in the web-application itself in order to debug any issues I had in particular lines. I also played around with the index.html and CSS to style the web-application a little differently so I can continuously implement the things that I have learned in class. Moreover, I had difficulty uploading this project into my repository, and configured my issue by myself. I didn't want to waste time so I started working on this project through the starter code. I resolved my issue by creating a repository and cloning the SSH key to my computer, then adding all the work I did on the starter code into my repository manually, and finally doing a git pull to see that my repository is linked to my GitHub. This project was more difficult than the previous ones, but does not discourage me from coding. I will go back to my lectures again and again and utilize my resources to confidently navigate through JavaScript. 

## Installation

## Credits
I did not use a 1 on 1 tutor this week due to my own negligence 

However I did use this youtube video to help get my project started:
